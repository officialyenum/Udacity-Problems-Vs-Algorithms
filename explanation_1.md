Submission to Udacity's PROBLEMS-VS-ALGORITHMS Problems

Run time analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation) of solution

Get Time Taken to run using : time python <filename>

- How i solved this problem ?

This problem requires that you input a number and return back another number. my solution uses the 0(1) complexity to input a number modify that number and return the number

- TASK 1 : 0(1)

  - Space Complexities 
    - get floor number = 0(1)

  - Algorithm for sqrt Function :

    - get sqare root.0(1)
    - get floored number of square root 0(1)
