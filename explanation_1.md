Submission to Udacity's PROBLEMS-VS-ALGORITHMS Problems

Run time analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation) of solution

Get Time Taken to run using : time python <filename>

- Design choices -

  -This problem requires that you input a number and return back another number. my solution, i used the binary search algorithm to discard left and right elements till i got the square root using the 0(log n) complexity to return mid/result if sqrt and number is a perfect square

- TASK 1 : 0(log n)

  - Space complexity analysis-

    - start number = 0(1)
    - end number = 0(1)
    - mid number = 0(1)
    - result number = 0(1)

  - Logic explanation - Time complexity analysis-
  - Algorithm for sqrt Function :

    - get sqare root. 0(log n) using binary search while loop function
