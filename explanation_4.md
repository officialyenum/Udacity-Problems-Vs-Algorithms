Submission to Udacity's PROBLEMS-VS-ALGORITHMS Problems

Run time analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation) of solution

Get Time Taken to run using : time python <filename>

- Design choices -
  - This problem requires that you sort the list in a single traversal, solution uses the linear search algorithm 0(n) complexity to sort the list with a while loop and ensuring it runs from 0 to n where n is the length of input list and return a list 
  

- TASK 4 : 0(n)

    * Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm. 

    * Space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. 

  - Space complexity analysis-
    - input_list = 0(1)

  - Logic explanation - Time complexity analysis-
  - Algorithm for Dutch National Flag Problem using sort 012 algorithm :
    - traverse from front_index to end_pos_2 input list indexes 0(n) using while loop till front index is <= end_pos_2
    - return sorted Input List 0(1)
